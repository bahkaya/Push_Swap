1 - arguments has to be parsed (if there is only one argument)
	then check with ft_isdigit because the of the rules
		after that split the char av[i] or av[0] correct format example "50 40 30" to "50" "40" "30"
			put it the ft_atoi (don't forget to free after atoi !("50", "40", "30")!)
				still don't know the what does stack mean ? (how can I put it to my stack)
